/*
 Initially hide all paragraphs within story blocks that might be "x min read". We can't test based
 on content with CSS, so we have to hide all candidates, remove using JS, and then remove this
 stylesheet. This can catch some other paragraphs without specific classes, but if it does they'll
 appear quickly, so it's not the end of the world. If the NYT would use a specific class on the
 "x min read" paragraphs, this could be done entirely through CSS.

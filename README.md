# New York Times Byline Restorer

The New York Times removed bylines from its homepage in August 2018. This browser extension adds them back.

## Installing

### Safari

Safari 12 removed support for developer-signed extensions, but I’ve made the code available as a userscript that can be used with the Tampermonkey extension, which can still be installed from the Safari Extensions Gallery:

  1. [Install the Tampermonkey extension](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=net.tampermonkey.safari-G3XV72R5TC).
  2. Click the Tampermonkey toolbar button and click Dashboard.
  3. Open the Utilities tab.
  4. In the URL field, paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dstillman/nyt-byline-restorer/master/userscript.js` and click Import.

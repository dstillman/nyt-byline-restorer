# New York Times Byline Restorer

The New York Times removed bylines from its homepage in August 2018. This browser extension adds them back.

### Safari

As of Safari 12, it’s no longer possible to easily create and distribute Safari extensions, but I’ve made the code available as a userscript that can be used with the Tampermonkey extension, which is available in the Safari Extensions Gallery through at least December 2018:

  1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=net.tampermonkey.safari-G3XV72R5TC).
  2. Click the Tampermonkey toolbar button and select Dashboard.
  3. Open the Utilities tab.
  4. In the URL field, paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dstillman/nyt-byline-restorer/master/userscript.js` and click Import.
